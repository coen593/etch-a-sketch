# etch-a-sketch

This is my version of the Etch-a-Sketch assignment, which is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

Using it is simple: either drag over the drawing area with your mouse button down (on computer) or simply touch and drag (on mobile) and draw whatever you want in the grid.

It's possible to change the color used, as well as work in greyscale (the grey gets darker the longer you hold it down) and with random colors. It's possible to resize the grid using the slider.

The app is completely responsive and works on both computer and mobile.
